# Share a smile

I want to share my experience about it. Being a mother it's such a great experience because you accumulate unforgettable moments in your heart and soul, but also you accumulate toys, clothes, and accessories unused, and then you don't know what to do with all of them. Well, that's why we develop the application called Share a Smile, this is a social network app made for people who wants to connect with others to buy, sell or donate children's items, therefore, making happy children and parents.


## Basic elements of a social media
In this project, Social media are a collection of technologies that enable people to, listen, create, share, connect, amplify and measure media (content) with one another. This all generally happens in an environment free from the constraints of gatekeepers or approval processes, and by definition on platforms that require two-way and multi-way communications.

As a result, five inter-related elements of social media have become available.

-   Listening (Research)
-   Content Marketing (Content Creation and Curation)
-   Engagement (Community Management)
-   Promotion (Advertising)
-   Measurement (Metrics, KPIs, and Analytics)

## Usability survey

We ask at least 30 people who had children or nephew, who did not use the children's toys and clothes no longer. At least 89% of them do not know what to do with so many articles that nobody uses.

In addition, we have been tested to find out which is the preferred color of the application, showing the following results.
